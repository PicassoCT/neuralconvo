[2:49:28 PM] <Licho> will openal explode if i use it from ZKL at the same time spring uses it? Does anyone know?
[2:55:19 PM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> works fine
[2:55:23 PM] <Nightwatch> <BrainDamage> it's not daemon, it's a wrapper lib
[2:55:27 PM] <Nightwatch> <BrainDamage> and SL uses it too

[10:53:06 AM] <Nightwatch> <Floris> what gfx settings are costy for the cpu?
[10:53:29 AM] <Nightwatch> <Floris> shadows are one, but already wrote a shadow quality manager widget for that
[10:53:44 AM] <Nightwatch> <Floris> might aswell find other settings i can deactivate at low fps

[7:42:44 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> Wow, server download speed is sucking atm
[7:42:52 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> [LCC]jK
[7:42:57 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> I've always wondered this...
[7:43:44 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> Since git is so pervasive, and has versioning... WHy do we need rapid? Why don't we set up a system of some sort where the lobbies simply grab the game files from git?

[8:05:34 PM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> git is the history
[8:05:38 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> Ahh ok
[8:06:14 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> Just checked my .git folder for evo
[8:06:15 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> 1gb
[8:06:22 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> But I do have multiple branches too
[8:06:22 PM] <Nightwatch> <hokomoko> you could use github's api but it would be ugly
[8:07:48 PM] <Nightwatch> <gajop> well.. it is possible to dump history though
[8:08:40 PM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> after you cloned it
[8:08:52 PM] <Nightwatch> <gajop> this is not something a developed project should do, but it's not as insane as it sounds (opening up a project to the public would make it OK to dump history imo)
[8:12:29 PM] <Nightwatch> <GargantuaSauce> github also has a specific limit of 100MB per file
[8:20:26 PM] <ikinz> You can make a shallow clone of course, but you'll have other problems like you can't have separate versions side by side without doing separate checkouts, even if you hardlink them it's a mess. And if you go all the way and teach spring to read blobs from .git dir, you've basically reinvented rapid using ugly hacks.
[7:44:19 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> I could understand not doing it that way with svn, cause svn craps all over the place, but git doesn't
[7:44:47 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> And iirc, the games using svn atm still get pulled into the spring server into a git repo anyway
[7:45:07 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> My point was though that instead of using the spring server resources for game downloading
[7:45:28 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> all that load could be put squarely upon wherever the git repo is hosting (usually github)
[7:54:59 PM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> cause git repos are multiple GBs large
[7:59:42 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> Certainly not jsut the head revision
[7:59:56 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> You wouldn't need to grab all the history
[8:00:31 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> Or is that simply what would happen as a result of it being updated over time I guess?
[8:01:01 PM] <Nightwatch> <[Evo]Forboding_Angel> Wouldn't it be simple enough to periodically dump the history (assuming that the suer wanted that)?
[8:05:08 PM] <Nightwatch> <GargantuaSauce> it actually baffles me that you're unaware of the reason why git is unsuitable for distributing large binaries
[8:05:10 PM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> [Evo]Forboding_Angel: You wouldn't need to grab all the history > seems you don;t understand git
[7:48:28 AM] <Nightwatch> <bluestone_irc> looks good, thanks :)

[7:50:45 AM] <Nightwatch> <detrino> still no copying
[7:51:56 AM] <Nightwatch> <bluestone_irc> yeah
[7:52:15 AM] <Nightwatch> <detrino> as long as MakeData is inlined you are good
[7:53:07 AM] <Nightwatch> <detrino> and the compiler will always inline it if it is static or in an anonymous namespace and only called once
[7:53:50 AM] <Nightwatch> <bluestone_irc> yeah thats a very neat solution
[7:54:49 AM] <Nightwatch> <detrino> actually
[7:54:55 AM] <Nightwatch> <detrino> the inlining isnt even neccesary
[7:55:00 AM] <Nightwatch> <detrino> just NRVO alone handles this

[3:08:11 AM] <Nightwatch> <Picassorieusly> lets say it thus, you can work with vim 
[3:08:42 AM] <Nightwatch> <Picassorieusly> but the levle of entrance is expensive- and thus you deny a lot of clever people who would have otherwise be able to contribute access to your project

[2:38:14 AM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> numMoveDefs == 0?
[2:41:16 AM] <Nightwatch> <gajop> [LCC]jK: maybe because i'm working on ingamelobby that has no units?
[2:42:32 AM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> you have commit access
[2:42:51 AM] <Nightwatch> <[LCC]jK> you can either commit assert() + LOG(), or you can fix the codes ;)
